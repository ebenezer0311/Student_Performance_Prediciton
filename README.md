# Student Performance Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict student performance using linear regression based on certain input features. By analyzing historical data, the model can provide insights into potential factors affecting student outcomes.

## Introduction
Predicting student performance can have significant educational implications. This project employs a linear regression model to predict student scores based on features such as study hours, attendance, and failures background.

## Features
- Utilizes linear regression for predictive analysis.
- Easy-to-use interface to input student features and get performance predictions.
- Provides insight into which features have a stronger influence on student performance.

## Requirements(used)
- Python (version 3.11)
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn (sklearn),pickle
